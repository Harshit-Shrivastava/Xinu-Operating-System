1. Yes, the program outputs garbage (unexpected) values. This is because of context switching between the producer and the consumer. 

When the waiting process resumes, this process runs from the previous state stored in the PCB. Hence the garbage values.

2. Not all the values are getting consumed by the consumer. For a small count of value 20, the final value 20 is being printed by the consumer. Xinu does execute processes concurrently, Inspite of that, the producer runs to the end of its execution cycle before the consumer starts executing.

Producer() - Venkat Sambandhan - The Producer is the first process to run. The job of the producer is to iterate through a loop for a user defined count or default count of 2000, initialise a value to the external (global) variable(shared buffer) n and prints out the produced value.

Consumer() - Harshit Shrivastava - The consumer function iterates through a loop for a user defined count or default count of 2000, and prints the value of shared buffer/ global variable n.
